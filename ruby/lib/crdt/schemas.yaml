- name: PeerID
  type: fixed
  size: 32
  doc: >-
    256-bit globally unique identifier that uniquely identifies a particular device
    (client node). For now this is just random, though it could also be a hash of the
    device's public key, or something along those lines.

- name: ItemID
  type: record
  doc: >-
    A compact identifier that is unique within one data structure, and totally ordered. It is used
    to identify an item within a data structure (e.g. an element in a list) unambiguously.
  fields:
    - name: logicalTS
      type: long
      doc: >-
        A logical timestamp (Lamport clock); equivalently, the sum of all entries in a vector clock.
    - name: peerIndex
      type: long
      doc: >-
        Identifies the peer on which this ItemID originated. This number is functionally equivalent
        to a PeerID, but it is more compact: it is the index of the peer in the PeerState's array of
        peers. The ordering of this array is different on different peers, so the index is
        translated from the remote view to the local view on arrival.

- name: ClockUpdate
  type: record
  doc: >-
    A ClockUpdate may be sent as part of a message broadcast from one peer to all other peers,
    indicating any change of vector clock at the sender. This also identifies the causal
    dependencies of any following operations.
  fields:
    - name: nextTS
      type: long
      doc: >-
        Counter portion of the logical timestamp (Lamport timestamp) to be used for constructing the
        ItemID of the next operation following this ClockUpdate. Recipients can construct the ItemID
        by combining this logicalTS with the peerIndex of the sender. Subsequent operations will
        have logicalTS incremented by 1 for each operation, until the next ClockUpdate advances
        logicalTS. This field must never be less than or equal to a previous operation's logicalTS,
        to ensure that Lamport timestamps are always monotonically increasing.
    - name: updates
      doc: >-
        List of any changes that occurred in the sender peer's vector clock since the last
        ClockUpdate message was sent. For any peers not listed, the clock value has not changed.
        The elements of this array must be in order of ascending peerIndex.
      type:
        type: array
        items:
          name: PeerClockUpdate
          type: record
          doc: >-
            Records that the sender of this update has received operations from a particular peer.
            The first time that a particular peer is seen, this update also serves to notify others
            about the peerIndex that this sender will use as compact representation of the PeerID.
          fields:
            - name: peerID
              type: ["null", PeerID]
              default: null
              doc: >-
                Globally unique identifier for the peer being described. This only needs to be
                included the first time an update is sent for a particular peer; on subsequent
                updates, the peerIndex is sufficient, and so the peerID can be set to null.
            - name: peerIndex
              type: long
              doc: >-
                Index of this peer in the sender PeerState's array of peers. This index will serve
                as compact representation of the PeerID in subsequent updates from the same sender.
            - name: lastSeqNo
              type: long
              doc: Highest message sequence number that the sender has seen from this peer.

- name: SchemaUpdate
  type: record
  doc: >-
    A SchemaUpdate operation is broadcast when a new version of the application schema comes into
    use for the first time. Subsequent CRDT operations can refer to the ItemID of this schema update
    operation in order to make clear the schema version in which an edit is made. Schema evolution
    allows peers using different versions of the schema to interoperate.
  fields:
    - name: appVersion
      type: string
      default: ""
      doc: Application version number that uses this schema (for informational purposes).
    - name: appSchema
      type: string
      doc: Avro schema for a document, in JSON format, as defined by the application.
    - name: opSchema
      type: string
      doc: >-
        Avro schema for a single CRDT modification operation, used to parse Operation records. This
        schema is automatically generated from the appSchema and may contain various different
        operation types, for example register-writing operations for various different datatypes
        that occur in the appSchema.

- name: Operation
  type: record
  doc: Encoding of a single mutation made to a CRDT object.
  fields:
    - name: target
      type: ItemID
      doc: >-
        Identifies the object being modified in this operation, by referencing the logical timestamp
        of the operation that created the object in question. In the special case of the root object
        of a document being created, this references the operation itself, but otherwise it always
        references a prior operation.
    - name: operation
      type: bytes
      doc: >-
        The Avro encoding of a AppOperation record, which contains the various application-specific
        operation types. Encoded using the opSchema in the SchemaUpdate referenced in the message
        header.

- name: Message
  type: record
  doc: Packet of information that is broadcast from one peer to all other peers.
  fields:
    - name: schemaID
      type: ItemID
      doc: >-
        Reference to a prior SchemaUpdate operation that defined the application data schema being
        used in this operation. The operations are decoded using the opSchema given in that message.
    - name: timestamp
      type: long
      doc: >-
        The wall-clock time at which this message was created, in milliseconds since the 1970 epoch,
        according to the local clock on the node that sent the message. This field is used purely
        for informational purposes; none of the correctness of the algorithms depends on time.
    - name: operations
      doc: Sequence of operations that have taken place at the origin peer.
      type:
        type: array
        items: [ClockUpdate, SchemaUpdate, Operation]

#####################################################
# Stuff that is specific to the text editor example #
#####################################################

- name: InitializeRecordField
  type: record
  doc: >-
    Every time an instance of a record of the application schema is created in the document (at a
    minimum, when the root object is created), one of these operations must be issued for every
    field defined in that record type. The purpose is to assign an ItemID to every field (so that
    subsequent register-setting operations can target it). This operation does not assign a value;
    that is done in a subsequent operation.
  fields:
    - name: fieldNum
      type: int
      doc: >-
        The index of the field being initialized in the list of fields for the targeted record, as
        defined in the appSchema, indexed starting from 0.

- name: PutCursor
  type: record
  doc: >-
    Operation recording the fact that a key-value pair was put into a map object. The map maintains
    a unique value per key, so if there are multiple concurrent puts for the same key, the values
    are merged together according to the value CRDT merge function.
  fields:
    - name: mapKey
      type: PeerID
      doc: The key we're putting into the map.
    - name: mapValue
      type: ["null", ItemID]
      doc: The value we're putting into the map.

- name: SetCursor
  type: record
  doc: Operation recording the fact that the value of a register was overwritten.
  fields:
    - name: registerValue
      type: ["null", ItemID]
      doc: The new value of the register, encoded according to the register schema definition.
    - name: isSetCursor
      type: boolean
      doc: >-
        Unnecessary placeholder field. This field exists only because the Ruby Avro implementation
        handles unions badly: since the only field in this record is nullable, any hash matches the
        schema for the SetCursor record. Adding an additional required field helps distinguish this
        record type from other types in the union.

- name: InsertCharacter
  type: record
  doc: Operation recording the fact that an item was inserted into an ordered list.
  fields:
    - name: referenceID
      type: ["null", ItemID]
      doc: >-
        Identifies the location at which the new item should be inserted. If null, the item is
        inserted at the beginning of the list. Otherwise, this field is the ID of the item
        immediately to the left of the inserted item (i.e. its immediate predecessor).
    - name: value
      type: string
      doc: The value inserted into the list, encoded according to the list schema definition.

- name: DeleteCharacter
  type: record
  doc: Operation recording the fact that an item was deleted from an ordered list.
  fields:
    - name: isDeleteCharacter
      type: boolean
      doc: >-
        Unnecessary placeholder field. This field exists only because the Ruby Avro implementation
        handles unions badly: since this record has no other fields, any hash matches the schema for
        the DeleteCharacter record. Adding an additional required field helps distinguish this
        record type from other types in the union.

- name: AppOperation
  type: record
  fields:
    - name: operation
      type: [InitializeRecordField, PutCursor, SetCursor, InsertCharacter, DeleteCharacter]

- name: OrderedList
  type: record
  doc: Stores a peer's local state for a CRDT containing an ordered list of items.
  fields:
    - name: items
      doc: The items of the list, in correct application order, including tombstones.
      default: []
      type:
        type: array
        items:
          name: OrderedListItem
          type: record
          doc: One item of an ordered list.
          fields:
            - name: id
              type: ItemID
              doc: >-
                Immutable identifier for this list item, assigned when the item is inserted. The ID is
                unique within this list, but not globally unique. Subsequent operations that need to
                refer to a particular item in the list may use this identifier.
            - name: value
              type: ["null", string]
              doc: >-
                The application-specified value of this list item. Set to null when the item is
                deleted from the list.
            - name: deleteTS
              type: ["null", ItemID]
              doc: >-
                Tombstone timestamp. As long as the list item has not been deleted, this field is set
                to null. When it is deleted, the field is set to the timestamp of the deletion
                operation.

- name: TextDocument
  type: record
  fields:
    - name: cursors
      type:
        type: array
        items:
          name: CursorByPeer
          type: record
          fields:
            - name: id
              type: ItemID
              doc: >-
                Immutable identifier for this map item, assigned when the item is put into the map.
            - name: updateTS
              type: ItemID
              doc: >-
                Logical timestamp of the operation that last updated the value for this map item.
                This is used to resolve concurrent updates (in LWW register fashion). Note that in
                the particular case of a map of cursor positions, this timestamp actually isn't
                needed, since it is keyed by PeerID and each peer only writes its own entry, so the
                registers are single-writer. However, we're including it anyway for the sake of
                generality of the map code.
            - name: key
              type: PeerID
              doc: >-
                The ID of the peer whose cursor position is described here. It is assumed that the
                array contains only one entry for a given peer, so the peer is effectively the key
                of a map data structure. (We use an array instead of an Avro map because Avro maps
                only support string keys.)
            - name: value
              type: ["null", ItemID]
              doc: >-
                The unique ID of the character at the current cursor position, or null if the cursor
                is currently at the end of the document. This is the character that would be deleted
                if you press the delete key. Pressing backspace would delete the character before
                the current cursor position, and typing a letter would insert the letter before the
                current cursor position. Since this field is only set by the peer described in the
                key field, it is single-writer, and thus does not require a logical timestamp for
                LWW conflict resolution.
    - name: characters
      type: OrderedList

- name: PeerState
  type: record
  doc: >-
    Records the state of a peer device and its knowledge about other peers. This structure is
    written to stable storage when a peer shuts down, and loaded when it comes back up.
  fields:
    - name: channelID
      doc: >-
        Globally unique identifier of the message channel on the server on which all edits of this
        document are stored and broadcast.

        type: fixed
        size: 16
    - name: channelOffset
      type: long
      default: -1
      doc: >-
        Every message on a channel has a monotonically increasing offset. This field stores the
        highest message offset that this peer has received. It is used when reconnecting to the
        server after some time offline, to catch up on any messages that were added to the channel
        while the client was away. The offset is initially -1 (if no message has been received).
    - name: secretKey
      doc: >-
        Symmetric secret key used to encrypt messages on the channel by NaCl's SecretBox feature
        (XSalsa20 stream cipher with Poly1305 authenticator, nonces are handled automatically).

      type: ["null", {name: SecretKey, type: fixed, size: 32}]
    - name: defaultSchemaID
      type: ItemID
      doc: >-
        The operation ID of the SchemaUpdate message that recorded the application schema on the
        channel. This ItemID is embedded in the header of operations so that other peers know what
        schema the operations refer to.
    - name: cursorsItemID
      type: ItemID
      doc: The operation target to use for modifications to the map of cursor positions.
    - name: charactersItemID
      type: ItemID
      doc: The operation target to sue for modifications to the list of characters.
    - name: peers
      doc: >-
        List of all the peers that this peer is aware of. The first entry in this array is this peer
        itself (the one on which this structure is stored), subsequent entries are other peers.
      type:

            - name: nextTS
              type: long
              doc: >-
                The counter portion of the logical timestamp that should be applied to the next
                operation received from this peer. By default this is the counter from the last
                operation incremented by 1, but ClockUpdate operations may from time to time make
                this value jump forwards.
            - name: vclock
              doc: >-
                For each peer we record a vector clock that summarizes that peer's view of the world.
                The first entry in this array is always that peer's view of itself, and subsequent
                entries are its view of other peers. The index of a peer in this array is often used
                as a more compact alternative to the PeerID.

                        The highest senderSeqNo we have seen on messages from this peer. We expect
                        messages from a given peer to be sequentially numbered (with no gaps in the
